# City Pop - Vue

> Just a landing page made with Vue explaining the _Citypop_ music genre.

Mainly a project to get my hands dirty with SCSS and Vuetify.

The list of albums are fetched from the ExpressJS server.

## Setup

Run the following commands to setup the development server:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/leo-dh/citypop-landing-page

```
